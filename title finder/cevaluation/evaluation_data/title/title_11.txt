The Making of Dishes. The dish-maker takes | along his ax
when he goes into the woods. When he | reaches a patch of alder-
trees, he picks out a good one that has no knots and that is not
twisted, for he is || careful that it is straight when it is split in
two. After he has found a good one, he chops it down. It must
be six spans around at the bottom. When it falls down, he chops
off one fathom length from the tough part at the butt, | and he
measures off four spans in length and || chops it off there. After it
has been cut off, he splits it in two | straight through the heart of
the wood. After it has been split in two, he chops off the heart of
the wood, so that the block is one span thick. He chops it off
carefully, so that it is level and that it has no twist, | for the heart
of the tree will be the bottom of the dish. When this is done, || he
chops out the sides so that they are wide in the middle. The dish
is one span wide | at each end, and it is one span and four | fingers
wide in the middle, for it bulges out. | The bottom part of the end
is one short span long, | and the height is one hand-width, || including
the thumb. The bottom is one short span wide and three spans
