The Making of Oil-Boxes. I have forgotten to talk about the meas-

his back and goes into the woods, carrying his ax in one hand.
He is going to a place where he knows of a cedar-tree which has
moss on its back, and which has been lying on the ground for a long
time; for the box-maker looks for this kind of a tree when he wants
to make an oil-box, because it bends, and it does not split easily,
although the heat strikes it for a long time when they are trying
out the oil at Knight Inlet. As soon as he comes to a trunk that
has no branches or knots, he puts his wedge-bag down on the
ground and chops into the log near the top of the cedar-tree.

the place where he will put his wedges in. Now he starts
where he cut in, and measures off ten spans || and four finger-
widths. There he chops into the tree, and the chopping at
