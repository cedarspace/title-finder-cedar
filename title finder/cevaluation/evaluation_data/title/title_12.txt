Fresh Roasted Backbone. When the dog-salmon is cut by the
woman, | the dog-salmon is put on an old mat to be cut. Then | the
woman cuts off the gills of the dog-salmon, so that they are attached
only to the end of the intestines of the dog-salmon. Then she cuts
off the head; and as soon as it is off, the woman | begins to cut,
beginning at the back of the neck of the dog-salmon, and going to
four finger-widths from its tail. Then she cuts along the upper side
of the dorsal fin; | then she turns around what she is cutting, and she
cuts into it on the upper (dorsal) side where she stopped, four fin-
ger-widths from the tail of the dog-salmon. | Then she cuts it, beginning
from there, until she reaches the back of the neck. Then the meat
on the backbone is thick when she takes it off from the skin. When
there are many backbones, the woman | takes straight-splitting pine-
wood and she splits it in pieces to make roasting-tongs. These are
four spans in length. As soon as she finishes splitting them, she
puts them into the ground where she is working. Then she takes
the intestines of the dog-salmon and rubs them on the roasting-
tongs. As soon as they are all slimy, | she takes eedar-bark and ties
it around under the || split part of the roasting-tongs; and after she
finishes tying it, she takes the backbone and puts it crosswise into
the roasting-tongs; and as soon as | four have been put in, she ties a
piece of cedar-bark | just over them. Then she takes four more pieces
