Dog-Salmon Spawn. (Scattered spawn of the dog-salmon, | caught
in the upper part of the rivers when the dog-fish are spawning).-|
When a woman cuts the fish caught by her husband, | she takes a
high box and puts it down at her || left side at the place where she is
cutting; and after the woman has finished cutting the dog-salmon,
and when what she is cutting is opened out, then she scoops out
with her hands the scattered spawn and puts it into the tall box;
and after she has done so, and the box is full of the scattered
spawn, || her husband goes up and puts it down in the | corner of the
house. Then short boards are put down flat on top of it, that the
rain may not drip in when it rains. When that is done, he leaves
it, for the cover is not water-tight, for the men will always go and
take out some of it. |
