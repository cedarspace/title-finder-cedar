where he chopped into it. and when he has chopped down to the
heart of the tree, he chops off more chips, in order to spread it
wider for the wedges to be put in. When | the wedges can lie on
the sloping chopped side, he drives them in in this way: The first
one that he drives in is the longest one of
the board wedges at the far side from where
he stands.¹ He takes the next shorter one | next to it and drives
it in close to the one that he has driven in, and he takes the
next shorter one and drives it in close to the one that he drove
before; and the seven wedges are one shorter than the other as
they are driven into the end of the tree; and the one nearest |
to the workman is the shortest wedge. Then he | strikes the top
of each once while he is striking them with his stone hammer, | and
he strikes them backward and forward. | As soon as the wood
splits, he pries it off so that it falls on its back, and he marks ||
on the end the thickness of two fingers. Then | he takes his ax
and drives it in on the mark that he put on the wood. | After
he has done so, he again takes up his wedges and puts them
in as he did before when splitting out the block. | He continues
doing this as he keeps on splitting them off. Only || the first (board)
that he splits off is thick. The next one is only one | finger-width
thick if the cedar is very good, for generally the first one split off

order of the wedges. The split is placed vertically, not horizontally as described here.
