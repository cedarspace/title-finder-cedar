takes the bucket with fresh water. and pours it over the flounders
standing on edge on the stones. When the water has been poured
out, he quickly takes up the old mats and throws them over them; |
and it does not take long before he takes off the covering, for
(the flounders) are now done. | As soon as he has taken off the
whole covering of old mats, the man calls his numaym to sit
around the place where the flounders were steamed, to eat the
steamed flounders. The men all come and sit around | what they
are going to eat. When they are all there, each man takes one |
lounder, and they pinch off (the meat) and put it into their mouths;
and || after each has eaten one flounder, they take another one and
eat it; and when there are many flounders, then all the men try to
eat many flounders; and sometimes each man will eat four |
flounders when there are many. And when the flounder-eaters
finish, they go home to their houses, and they wash their hands;
and after they have done so, they drink a little water, after | rinsing
their mouths for the salty taste to come out. The reason why they
do not drink much water is because they are afraid to drink much
when they first taste the flounders steamed standing on edge on
stones, for then they would always want to drink water. There-
fore they only | drink a little water to wash down what they have
eaten. This also is not given at a feast to many tribes. That is |
all about this. |
