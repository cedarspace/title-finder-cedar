this has been done. the chief's speaker begins to
praise them. |
The guests never eat any of the stomach-fat of the mountain-goat,
but go out. This important feast || is given to many tribes; namely,
dried brisket and sides, and also the stomach-fat of the mountain-
goat; for there is a myth about it and about the seal, for it is
valued more highly than an oil-feast by many tribes. As soon as the
former guests enter their houses, they distribute the split cedar-
sticks, for all the guests carry them || to their wives with the stomach-
fat. The women at once | bite off a piece of the fat and chew it;
and after it has been chewed, | they put it on the end of a split cedar-
stick, so that there is a knob of fat at the end, for they only wish
it to be large enough to go into the mouth. They put the knob |
into the fire; and when the stomach-fat is melted, they put it into
the mouth and suck the knob. When all the melted tallow has
been sucked off, they put the knob into the fire again; and when it
begins to drip with the melted fat, they put it back into the mouth;
and they only stop when there is only skin left at the end of the
fat-stick. They only | suck it off and eat it. That is all about this. ||
