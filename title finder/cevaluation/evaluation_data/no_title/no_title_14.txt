As soon as she has finished this. she takes the basket
containing the gills out of the water and carries it to the house,
She puts it down by the side of the fire of her house. | She takes a
kettle and pours some water into it, and when it is half full she puts
it over the fire. When the water begins to boil, she takes the
k!umes (for that is the name of the gills when they are cooked)
out of the little basket and throws them into the boiling water.
When they are all in, she takes her fire-tongs and stirs (what is in
the kettle). The kettle is not | kept long on the fire, perhaps for |
half an hour or a little longer. Then it is taken off. | Now it is done
and she invites all those who like to eat gills with her. || As soon as
those come who are going to eat gills with spoons, she takes | the
spoons, gives one to each of those who are going to eat with it, then |
the woman takes the water and gives a drink to those who are going
to eat with spoons. After they have drunk, they eat with spoons. |
The guests eat with spoons the liquid and the stomachs of the kelp-
fish and its gills. They just blow out of their mouths the bones,
for there are bones in the gills of the various kinds of fish. After
they have eaten, | the woman takes water and gives it to those who
eat with spoons with her. | Then she cools with cold water those who
had eaten the gills with spoons, | for those who eat gill-soup perspire. ||
