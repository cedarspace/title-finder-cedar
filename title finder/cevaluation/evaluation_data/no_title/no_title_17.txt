takes her dish and her rib-strainer. and || she puts down the dish by
the side of the kettle with whole perch; | and she takes the rib-
strainer and lifts out the whole boiled perch and puts them into
the dish. She puts | all the perch crosswise into the dish. When
they are all in the dish, she goes and puts (the dish) down in front of
those || who are going to eat the whole perch. The men immediately |
pick off (the meat) and put it into the mouth. When they have
nearly eaten everything, the host takes | spoons and gives one to
each of his guests; and as soon as | each has one, he takes up the
kettle in which the perch had been boiled and || pours the liquid of
the boiled perch into the dish. He pours it on what is left over
of the boiled perch. As soon as the dishes are nearly full, he goes
back, carrying the kettle; | and he puts it down at the end of the
fire, towards the door. Then the men eat with spoons the liquid
and the gills and the stomach, || as it has been boiled, and the intes-
tines; and when they have eaten enough, they stop. That is what
the ancient Indians call "washing down the food." Then they go
out. They never drink water, for they know that they will drink
water when they notice a salty taste of what they have eaten, | and
it is not very long before they wish to drink water. Then they
drink. That is all. |
