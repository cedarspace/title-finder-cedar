Cedar-Bark Breaker. The man takes a (bone from the) | nasal

bone of a whale, and he takes a thin-edged rough sandstone | and a

small dish, and he pours water into it so that it is half full. Then

he puts it down where he is going to work at a cedar-bark breaker.||

Ile takes the bone and measures it so that it is two spans and four

finger-widths in length. | Then he puts the rough sandstone into the

water in the dish, and he saws the bone off so that the end is square.

He does the same with the other end. When both ends are square, |||

he rubs the edges so that they are straight; and when the edges are

straight, | he measures the width of one hand for its width, and | he

measures with a cedar-stick to find the center, in this manner.ยน |

As soon as he finds the center, he marks a line across, and he rubs [

on each side of the line to make a hole through it, which serves as

a grip. As soon as he has finished rubbing the hole through

which serves as a grip, he rubs along the lower edge so as to

sharpen it. Now he has finished the bark-breaker. |

Bag of Sea-Lion Hide. As soon as this is done, he takes the | skin

of a sea-lion which has been dried. He spreads it out, and he ||

measures two spans. Then he puts a straight-edge of cedar-wood on
