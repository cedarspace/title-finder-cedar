Sewing with Cedar-Withes. The man takes a long bone drill and two
split boards which he places side by side. Then he | drills close to the
end slanting, and passes through the edges of the | two split boards, so
that the end of the drill passes out
other side of the || other board, thus:
as he comes to the end, he takes his
and cuts a groove into it, in which the
withes lie. After cutting the grooves, he turns it over and cuts a groove
on the other side, where no groove has been cut (on the upper side).
When he gets to the end, he takes the twisted cedar-withes and puts the
thin end through (1). || He pulls it; and when it reaches the thick end,
he takes a cedar stick and cuts it so that it has a sharp point, and
drives it in alongside of the cedar-withe. Then the end of the cedar-
withe comes out at (2). He pulls it tight and twists it, and
pushes it in at (3), and it comes out at (4). He pulls it tight, and||
hammers it with a diabase pebble so as to drive it into the groove,
while another man is pulling the cedar-withe, for it always requires
two men to work at boards. He twists the | cedar-withe tight and
smooth and pushes the thin end into (5), and it comes out at (6).
He pulls at it and hammers it with the stone; || and when it lies in
the groove, he twists the cedar-withe and pushes it into (7), so that
it comes out at (8); and | he does the same as he did before; and
