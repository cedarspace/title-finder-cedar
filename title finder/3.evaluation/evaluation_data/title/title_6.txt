Care of Canoe. I forgot this when I was talking about the canoe-
builder, who spreads open the canoe, making a small canoe. When
he pours water into it, and the stones are nearly red-hot, | he
pours four buckets of water, and there is one bucket of urine which
he pours into the canoe, and he carries four more buckets of water,
pours them into it, and he also carries one bucket of urine | and
pours it into the water in the small canoe. Then eight buckets of
water have been poured into the small canoe, and two buckets
of urine, so that it may not be split by the heat of the sun after the
canoe-builder shall have finished it. That is the reason why they
put urine into it. As soon as enough | water and urine are put into
it, he puts red-hot stones into the canoe. When the canoe-builder
finishes this, || he takes a rush mat and a dish or a small steaming-
box and perch-oil (that is the oil obtained from | perch-liver). He
places the steaming-box by the side of the fire of his house, and | he
takes the rush mat and puts it into the fire. | As soon as it burns, he
places it on the side of the steaming-box, so that || the charcoal falls
into the box. When he thinks he has enough, | he takes his hammer
