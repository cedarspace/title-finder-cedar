runs outward: therefore. the first one that is split off is thick. |
i
As soon as it has been split, he carries the boards out as he is going
home; and when he has carried them all out, he takes his adz |
and adzes them smooth. When he has finished | one side, he turns
them over and adzes the other side also; so that they all have the
same thickness. When they are half a finger-width thick, | they
are done, and he puts them on edge. Then he adzes down || one
edge to make it straight; and after that has been done, he puts them
down flat, takes a piece of cedar-stick and splits it so that it is
thin, and he takes his straight knife and cuts off the end so that | it
is square at the end. He measures one span | and a short span,
beginning at the end that he cut off, || and there he cuts it off. He
uses this as a measure for the width of the box that he is making.
He puts it down and takes his straight knife, and again puts on
edge the board out of which he is making the box. Then he shaves

off the edge smooth, so that it is very | straight and smooth; and
when it is really straight, he puts it down flat. Then he takes his |
cedar-stick measure and puts it down on one end of the box | that
he is making. The end of the measure is flush with the straight
edge that he has shaved off. He marks with his knife | the other end
