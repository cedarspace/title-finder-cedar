marriage-present to the wife of the mountain-goat hunter.ยน He
must give a marriage-feast of stomach-fat of the mountain-goat | to
the chief, although she is his own wife. Now he has given for a marriage-
feast the stomach-fat of the mountain-goat, and the dried brisket, ||
and the dried sides, to his father-in-law; and sometimes there are
as many as eight large boxes full. When it is thoroughly dried, |
his wife puts it into boxes; and when he gives it to his father-in-law
to give a marriage-feast, then the people at once take a new | small
canoe and carry it into the house of the chief. They put it down at
the left-hand side of the door of the house. They carry in | much
water and pour it into the small canoe; | and when it is nearly half full,
they stop pouring in the water, and they open the boxes of dried
brisket and the boxes of dried sides. They put them into the water
in the small canoe. | There they are soaked. When they are all in,
they put short boards over them; and they take large stones and
put them on to keep the dried brisket and the dried sides under
water. After they have been soaked for three days, the chief calls |
all the tribes to come and eat dried || mountain-goat briskets. As
soon as the one who invites | all the men goes, the chief's numaym carry
up | many fresh stones and put them into the fire in the middle of
ยน As though the hunter's son or his wife were the chief's daughter.
