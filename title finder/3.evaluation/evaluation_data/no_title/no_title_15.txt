the scales and the skin. and when it is all off, | she eats it. She does not
dip it into grease, because it is very fat. | I have forgotten this, that
the woman also beats the body of the kelp-fish before she puts it
down on its stomach to roast by the fire, || so as to loosen the bones
from the meat. |
After she has eaten the kelp-fish, she drinks | water, but not much,
for it tastes salt. That is the reason why she does not drink much |
water, for she knows that she has to keep on drinking water. | Only
the one who has caught the fish eats it roasted by the fire while lying
on its stomach; || for she only does this with the kelp-fish when she
is very hungry when she comes home, after having been fishing
with her fish-trap. That is the reason why she puts one kelp-fish
down on its belly by the fire, | for it takes a very short time to be
done. Old women | eat kelp-fish roasted by the fire while lying on
its belly; for it is || too dirty for young women, because the intes-
tines and the gills are in it, and the scales are also on it; for | they
are afraid to eat the scales of the fish, because it often kills | those
who eat them with the meat, because they stick in the throat and
they can not get out the scales when they eat the kelp-fish. There
is no way of getting them out when they are || stuck in the throat,
and our throat gets sore when we | swallow them. Now I have
finished talking about this. |
